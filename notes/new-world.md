# NEW WORLD

This machine is ours, and we must know every corner of it.

A tight iteration loop requires deft tools to navigate the loop.

New world task geared for game testing:
 1. deploy new contracts
 2. register arena address
 3. approve staking
 4. bulk mint wamos
 5. create game and stake wamos

At this point, the game id could be entered in the browser and the game played immediately, with under a 10 second turn around between updates.

Obstacle:
 - devs must sync their new world artifacts
 - task must mint wamos in bulk for all devs
