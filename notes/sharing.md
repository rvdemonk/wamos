# sharing worlds

each dev wants a personal world and

## design
/dev-data.json : stores dev addresses 

/world.config.json
 - currentEnv : private or public

# todo

git ignore private artifacts but not shared
in world creation tasks check if world is public that dev is sure

now:
add network to artifact
task to toggle private mode
confirmation prompt for certain crud tasks on shared
update getWamosArtifact to check env
swap artifacts in frontend dir
