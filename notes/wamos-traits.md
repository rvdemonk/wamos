# WAMOS TRAITS

wamo represented by a single hash?

vrf -> abi.encode = wamos hash

## movements

no need to generate 8 separate moves; perhaps generate 2 or 3, and remaining movements are derivatives of these? forward and back movements, or mirrored?

## trait generation

how expensive would creating and sampling from a normal distribution be?
